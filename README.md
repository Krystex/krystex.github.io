# Personal blog

This is the repository of my [personal blog](https://krystex.github.io/).

It's written in markdown with the help of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme.

To build the site, execute this:
```bash
hugo
```

To develop the site, watch for changes and show drafts, execute this:
```bash
hugo server -D
```
